This is a work-in-progress [website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/M4Econ/) consisting of Matlab example code for manipulating various data structures, dynamic programming, graphing and associated tasks.

> [**bookdown site**](https://fanwangecon.github.io/M4Econ/bookdown) and [**bookdown pdf**](https://fanwangecon.github.io/M4Econ/bookdown/Data-Structures-and-Dynamic-Optimization-with-Matlab.pdf).

Materials gathered from various [projects](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research) in which matlab is used. Matlab files are linked below by section with livescript files. Tested with [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) 2019a. This is not a Matlab package, but a list of examples in PDF/HTML/Mlx formats. [MEconTools](https://fanwangecon.github.io/MEconTools/) is a package that can be installed with tools used in projects involving matlab code.

Bullet points in the Appendix show which matlab functions/commands are used to achieve various objectives. The goal of this repository is to make it easier to find/re-use codes produced for various projects. Some functions also rely on or correspond to functions from [MEconTools](https://github.com/FanWangEcon/MEconTools).

From other repositories: For code examples, see [Python Example Code](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Py4Econ/), [R Example Code](https://fanwangecon.github.io/R4Econ/), and [Stata Example Code](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Stata4Econ/); For intro stat with R, see [Intro Statistics for Undergraduates](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Stat4Econ/), and intro Math with Matlab, see [Intro Mathematics for Economists](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Math4Econ/).
