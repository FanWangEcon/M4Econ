% FUNCTION: [s, Pi] = fo_st_tauchen_jhl(mu, rho, sig, N)
%
% This function discretizes a continuous AR(1) process by using the method
% proposed by Tauchen (1986). The AR(1) process takes the following form:
% y(t) = mu + rho*y(t-1) + eps(t), where eps ~ N(0,sig^2)
% Parts of the code are taken from the function tauchen.m written by Martin
% Flodï¿½n.
%
% INPUTS
%   mu:     scalar, intercept term of the AR(1) process
%   rho:    scalar, AR-coefficient
%   sig:    scalar, standard deviation of innovations
%   N:      scalar, number of grid points for the discretized process
%
% OUTPUTS
%   s:      column vector of size Nx1, contains all possible states in ascending order
%   Pi:     matrix of size NxN, contains the transition proabilities. Rows
%           are current state and columns future state
